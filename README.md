# Inventory Control - RsS

## Introduction
This repository contains a set of inventory control algorithms used in the following publications:
 * Visentin, Andrea. Computing policy parameters for stochastic inventory control using stochastic dynamic programming approaches. Diss. University College Cork, 2020.
 * Visentin, Andrea, et al. "Computing optimal (R, s, S) policy parameters by a hybrid of branch-and-bound and stochastic dynamic programming." European Journal of Operational Research 294.1 (2021): 91-99. 
* Visentin, Andrea, et al. "Stochastic Dynamic Programming Heuristic for the (R, s, S) Policy Parameters Computation." arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.08803 (2022).


## Structure
The structure of the repository is organised as follow
* **solvers/** - contains the different policy parameters algorithms. It contains a sub-folder for each policy (sS, RS, RsS).
* **util/** - contains additional classes used to generate the problem instances and simulate their behaviour.
* **experiment_non_stationary.py** - is an example of the solutions usage.
